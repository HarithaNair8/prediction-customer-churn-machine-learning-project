# Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project
This project is focused on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to analyze historical customer data and build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to stop using a service soon.
## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, especially in telecom, subscription, and SaaS industries. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses classification models to predict whether a customer will churn based on features like usage, customer service interactions, tenure, and payment behavior.

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Model building & evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ML Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Null value treatment
   - Label encoding
   - Feature scaling

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Churn distribution
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Customer demographics and service usage

3. Model Training
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest

4. Evaluation Metrics
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Best performing model: Random Forest
- Accuracy achieved: 86%
- Insights:
  - Tenure and Monthly Charges were major drivers of churn
  - Customers with longer contracts were less likely to churn
